# TauNet

TauNet is designed for the raspberry pi and will allow for any user to send SMS messages (i.e. text messages) to another user over the internet securely, provided the user has the recipient in the address book. TauNet will use the RC4 encryption to send message securely. In addition, all users of TauNet need to have the same key for encryption and decryption. To establish a network, the TCP protocol will be used; this protocol is broken down into two subsections: the client (sender) and server (recipient).
